# flutterview_attach

A Demo for attach / detach FlutterView from FlutterEngine dynamically
you can press detach button to remove FlutterView and press attach button to reattach FlutterView
to FlutterEngine again.

This demo may crash on Flutter 1.20.x depends on Android Version which is the smallest code to
reproduce this issue. But on Flutter 1.17.x or lower version, it works fine.

## Getting Started

This project is not a runnable project. It just a demo show a crash issue on Flutter 1.20.x

The dart part of code is the original demo of Flutter Application. I just modified the `MainActivity` of Android.
